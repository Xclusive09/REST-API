## Known Limitations and Assumptions
- The API currently supports a maximum of 100 requests per minute per user.
- Authentication is not required for public endpoints, but it is needed for specific actions.
- Pagination is not implemented yet.

### Local Development and Deployment
- To set up and deploy the API locally or on a server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-api.git
cd your-api
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
3. Set environment variables by creating a .env file:
```bash
env
Copy code
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
```
4. Start the API server:

```bash
npm start
```
The API should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000. For production deployment, consider configuring a production-ready server, such as NGINX, and set up a MongoDB instance in the production environment.
